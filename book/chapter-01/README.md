###  Building Abstractions with Procedures

A computational process, an abstract being, is directed by a pattern of rules called programs and they could manipulate data, another abstract being.

In order to write a program, one uses a programming language. It is a set of symbolic expressions.

Writing a program can lead to mistakes that are known as bugs. Bugs can happen because of different reasons, and their consequences are usually chaotic. That's the reason software is built in a modular fashion, so that the parts can be constructed, replaced, and debugged separately.

### Programming in LISP

Human beings use a language for everyday thoughts, mathematical notation for quantitative issues, and now one will use a programming language for our procedural thoughts. This book us built around LISP.

LIPS is the academic result of John McCarthy's research about a computational model called "recursion equations" in 1950's.
